#Sum square difference
##Problem 5
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

*Answer: x*

Note: the computation of the difference has been obtained by simply calculate both the sum of the squares and the square of the sums; the algorithm used for this problem is extremely simple and possible optimizations should be introduced.
