# Even Fibonacci numbers
## Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

*Answer: 4613732*

Note: to solve this problem, I preferred to use the iterative version of the Fibonacci algorithm, instead of the recursive one; this way is easier to check if one of the current factor is a multiple of two.
